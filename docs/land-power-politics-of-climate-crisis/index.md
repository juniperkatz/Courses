3. **Compare Environmental Policy Frameworks**: Contrast major theoretical and practical frameworks for understanding the implementation, challenges, and effectiveness of environmental policies in different contexts.
4. **Apply Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)**: Employ QCA to systematically evaluate and draw insights from complex policy cases, identifying conditions that contribute to policy success or failure.
5. **Design and Execute Qualitative Policy Analyses**: Develop and apply rigorous coding frameworks to analyze qualitative data related to policy conflicts, decisions, and outcomes.
6. **Formulate Research Protocols**: Create comprehensive research designs for conducting comparative policy analysis, including case selection, data collection, and ethical considerations.

## University Policies

### Academic Honesty
Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent.

Academic integrity is the foundation of our academic community. Any form of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) will result in disciplinary action in accordance with university policies.
