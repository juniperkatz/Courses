## Welcome!

This course is one of the core requirements for both the MPPA and MPA
programs in the School of Public Policy. It introduces the study and
practice of public policy making. The content emphasizes the
institutions and political forces at work in the process of making
public policy at all levels of government in the United States. It is
grounded in what we know about the complex dynamics of the policy
process, as confirmed through scholarly research and practitioner
experience. It is an exploration and examination of the competing
impulses inherent in policy making. Ideas about problems, and their
solutions, are not only a product of rational analysis but arise from
complicated interactions among people and institutions. From a broad
perspective, however, policy making in the U.S. is inescapably
dominated by the decentralized structure, dispersed authority, and
special status of economic actors in American constitutional design,
all of which have been both reshaped and reinforced over time as the
nation has developed.

The goal of the course is to give students the background to devise
strategies to develop public policy and to understand theories about
how policy is made and the role of politics in policy. Course projects
and discussions expand your writing skills, analytical tools, and
knowledge of U.S. government.[^1]

## Overview & Expectations

All course materials (except for the textbook) are available on
Canvas. Assignments are turned in via the Canvas course unless you are
directed otherwise. The course contains a variety of learning
modalities including, but not limited to, lecture, group work,
analytical and reflective writing, discussion, and other activities.

**How to Succeed and What to Expect**

You can succeed in this course by referring to the syllabus and the
course Canvas frequently for assignment information and announcements.
Planning and developing effective work habits are a key part of
succeeding. Please communicate with me early and often about what is
working and not working for you in this class. I am here to help you
succeed.

- You are expected to use the [Canvas
course](https://umamherst.instructure.com/courses/13939) to submit
assignments.
- Learning Teams: Depending on class enrollment, you may be placed
into teams for activities.
- For general questions about the course and requirements, <u>check
the syllabus first</u>. You can also ask questions during class
meetings or schedule a one-on-one meeting. You can also email me
with questions.
- ***Communication:*** The primary way we will communicate, outside of
class meetings, is via our university email accounts. When you email
me, you will usually get a response within two days. If you have not
received a response within that period, please resend.
- ***Writing:*** Want to improve your writing skills? Graduate work –
and the work of policy professionals – require a great deal of
writing. The [University Writing
Center](https://www.umass.edu/writingcenter/) is a free service that
will help you improve your skills. It is a great service; take
advantage of it!
- ***Pronoun use:*** Everyone has the right to be addressed and
referred to by the name and pronoun that corresponds to their gender
identity. My pronouns are she/her.

## Objectives

Among other outcomes, upon successful completion of this course,
students will:

- Recognize the ways in which U.S. policy making institutions create
opportunities and obstacles for change;
- Evaluate the competing values we, as a polity, aspire to fulfill
through governmental action and conversely what our public policies
may reveal about our actual values;
- Compare how political processes can lead to incremental change
(Medicare expansion to include prescription drugs) or at times lead
to major shifts in policy (e.g., passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act);
- Identify how the politics around policy issues move from venue
(e.g., Congress) to venue (e.g., courts) over time, and how
conflicts continue even after court decisions, legislative passage,
or executive order;
- Assess how existing policies create new politics and other
unintended effects and the impacts of those effects on target
populations and citizen participation; and
- Participate in the policy making process by engaging in policy
activities such as attending a hearing, submitting a rulemaking
comment, or meeting with a policy actor on a specific public policy
issue.

The goals and learning objectives listed above support the School of
Public Policy MPA and MPPA competencies and are expressed in the
following activities:

| **MPA/MPPA target competency**                                              | **Relevant course activities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Analyze, synthesize, think creatively, solve problems, and make decisions* | In the case analysis assignment, students choose a policy and use their research, analysis, and decision skills to develop a case for establishing whether policy change has happened and if so, how. In presenting their case, students engage in public speaking, synthesis of information, effective communication through writing and speaking, knowledge generation, and applying course concepts. |
| *Participate in and contribute to the public policy process*                | In each of the case analysis assignments, students are required to engage in a real-world policy issue by engaging in activities such as writing an op-ed, submitting a public comment to the federal government’s rulemaking site, or otherwise engaging in the policy process.                                                                                                                        |

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to enter the course with a working knowledge of
U.S. government. If you have not taken a course on American Government
or if you want to assess your knowledge, you can take quizzes on

## Evaluation

### Assignments & Grading

Unless directed otherwise, deliver written assignments via the
submission process in Canvas. When submitting documents, name each
file with your last name and the assignment name (e.g.
katz\_rulemaking.docx). And, make sure that your name is on the first
page of the document. For all written assignments, please use
Microsoft Word or PDF. Although Canvas allows for other formats, the
teacher tools are best integrated with Word.
>
**Writing Format**: With the exception of class notes, students need
to provide citations in writing assignments. Use APA 7. Assignment
rubrics and additional instructions may be provided on Canvas.
>
**_Class_ Participation (20 pts)**. You are expected to fully prepare
for each class by doing the reading/watching/preparation related to
course content.

The primary assignment for the course is the development of a case study
analyzing the policy process, in connection with a public problem, and
the policy under development in response to it. A detailed description
of the assignment is available on Canvas.

Four evaluation criteria apply to each of the four steps in the
development of the case analysis. The scoring scale for each criterion
is 0 to 25. The average for the four criteria will yield the point total
for each assignment, and the total for the four assignments will
constitute the final course grade.

1. **Assignment** – Does the memo respond to the assignment?
2. **Analysis** – Does the memo present a coherent logic or narrative? Are its
claims credible (e.g., supported by evidence)?
3. **Grounding** – Does the memo use course materials and evidence collected as
part of the case study to inform analysis and observations?
4. **Readability** – Is the memo well-organized? Is the writing efficient and
clear? Is the paper generally free of typos, grammatical errors, and other
distractions?

## Course Procedures

### Course Policies

#### Late Work Policy

The deadlines for each assignment are posted in
this syllabus and on Canvas. It is your responsibility to manage your
course calendar and turn in assignments when required. If you are
struggling with assignment completion, reach out to me in an email.

In general, each assignment turned in after the due date will incur
**a .5-point penalty for each 24-hour period that it is late. Thus, an
assignment turned in 1 week after the due date will incur a 3.5-point
penalty**.

#### Civility

My commitment is to create a climate for learning
characterized by respect for each other and the contributions each
person makes to class. I request that you make a similar commitment.
We will also create a set of class norms together.

## University Policies

### Accommodation Statement:

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an
equal educational opportunity for all students. If you have a
documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file
with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable
academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course. If you
have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please
notify me within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may
make appropriate arrangements. For further information, please visit
[Disability Services](https://www.umass.edu/disability/).

### Academic Honesty Statement

Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of
higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research,
academic honesty is required of all students at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all
programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating
dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who
has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take
reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has
reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty
should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate
course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic
dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the
attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students
are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted
standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not
normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent.
